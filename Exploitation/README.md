## Tools for Exploitation

### 1. **Frameworks**
- **Metasploit Framework**: Exploitation and post-exploitation toolkit.
- **BeEF**: Web browser exploitation framework.
- **Impacket**: Tools for network protocol exploitation.

### 2. **Targeted Exploitation Tools**

## Best Practices

1. Prioritize high-impact vulnerabilities.
2. Use exploits validated in test environments.
3. Keep detailed logs of all exploitation activities.
4. Limit the scope to ensure compliance with engagement rules.
5. Use stealth techniques to avoid detection during exploitation.
