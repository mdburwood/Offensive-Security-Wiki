## Overview
Network exploitation focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in network services, protocols, and configurations.

## Tools for Network Exploitation

- **Nmap**: Scan for open ports and services.
- **Responder**: Intercept and analyze network traffic.
- **CrackMapExec**: Post-exploitation for network protocols.
- **Wireshark**: Analyze network packets.

## Best Practices

1. Enumerate services to identify misconfigurations.
2. Exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled test environment.
3. Use stealth techniques to avoid detection.
4. Document each step of the exploitation process.
