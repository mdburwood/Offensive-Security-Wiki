## Tools for Mobile and IoT Exploitation

### 1. **Mobile Exploitation**
- **MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)**: Static and dynamic analysis.
- **Frida**: Dynamic instrumentation toolkit.
- **APKTool**: Reverse engineer Android APKs.

### 2. **IoT Exploitation**
- **Firmware Analysis Toolkit**: Analyze firmware for vulnerabilities.
- **Binwalk**: Extract and analyze firmware images.
- **Shodan**: Identify exposed IoT devices.

## Best Practices

1. Assess mobile apps for data leakage and insecure storage.
2. Analyze IoT device firmware for hardcoded credentials.
3. Use controlled environments to avoid impacting live devices.
4. Document findings comprehensively.
